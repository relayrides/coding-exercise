# Show us your code

If you have existing code that you can share with us and are proud of, these exercises are optional—just send us a link to the repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).

## Turo Code Exercises

If you are doing an exercise, you can pick any of the ones below. You should plan on spending 30–120 minutes on the exercise.

### Server (Full-Stack)

#### Simple Database

We really like [Thumbtack’s Simple Database Challenge][sdb]. We couldn’t put it better than they did, so just follow their instructions and send us a link to your repository.

[sdb]: https://www.thumbtack.com/challenges/simple-database

You must include a README that explains:
1. how to execute your code 
2. your thought process. 
3. the performance characteristics of your solution

##### How We Review Your Submission

* **Functionality**: Does the solution satisfy all the logic requirements described above? Does it handle all edge cases properly and is it sufficiently tested?
* **Algorithmic performance**: Does the solution satisfy both the runtime and memory usage requirements outlined above?
* **Code style**: How readable is the code? Does it have a clear structure with abstraction and encapsulation that fit this problem? Is the solution overly-complex and over-engineered? Can you explain it?

### Client (Front-end)

#### Search

Build a rental car search app using a freely available public API (we like [Hotwire’s Shopping API][hotwire]). The user should be able to search by date and location.

We’ll be looking for clean, well-structured code and a polished user interface, regardless of the platform you choose to build on. Specific platform instructions are below.

##### Android

Use Java with standard Android XML layouts. You can use any libraries and tools you like, but please include a README that explains your approach and why specific technologies were used.

Send us the APK file and a link to your code repo.

##### iOS

Use Objective-C, Swift, or a combination of those. You may use additional libraries and tools, but be prepared to explain why. We are looking for a user experience consistent with Apple’s guidelines.  

Send us a link to the repo so we can build and run your code.

##### Web

The project should be a single page app with a single `index.html` that loads any scripts and stylesheets. The choice of technologies (Angular, React, LESS, etc.) are up to you, but please include a README that explains your approach and why specific technologies were used. 

Send us a link to your repository, as well as a hosted (Heroku, Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, etc.) version.


### Acknowledgements

In addition to Thumbtack, we have taken a decent helping of inspiration from [Uber’s coding challenge][uber].
