# Show us your code

If you have existing code that you can share with us and are proud of, these exercises are optional—just send us a link to the repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).

## Turo Code Exercises

If you are doing an exercise, you can pick any of the ones below. You should plan on spending 30–120 minutes on the exercise.

### Client (Front-end)

#### Search

Build a rental car search app using a freely available public API (we like [Hotwire’s Shopping API][hotwire]). The user should be able to search by date and location.

We’ll be looking for clean, well-structured code and a polished user interface, regardless of the platform you choose to build on. Specific platform instructions are below.

##### Android

Use Java with standard Android XML layouts. You can use any libraries and tools you like. Volley and Glide are not required but recommended. 

Send us the APK file so we can install on Android 4 or 5 and a link to your code repo. We want to see the details.

##### iOS

Use Objective-C, Swift, or a combination of those. You may use additional libraries and tools, but be prepared to explain why. We are looking for a user experience consistent with Apple’s guidelines.  

Send us a link to the repo so we can build and run your code.

##### Web

The project should be a single page app with a single `index.html` that loads any scripts and stylesheets. The choice of technologies (Angular, React, LESS, etc.) are up to you, but please include a README that explains your approach and why specific technologies were used. 

Send us a link to your repository, as well as a hosted (Heroku, Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, etc.) version.


### Server (Back-end)

#### Simple Database

We really like [Thumbtack’s Simple Database Challenge][sdb]. We couldn’t put it better than they did, so just follow their instructions and send us a link to your repository.

### Acknowledgements

In addition to Thumbtack, we have taken a decent helping of inspiration from [Uber’s coding challenge][uber].
